### local and session storage 

Local storage and session storage are two types of storage mechanisms available in modern web browsers. They are used to store data locally in the user's browser, and they differ in terms of how long they persist and how they are cleared.

we can access local storage and session storage using 
```js
localStorage."method_name"
sessionStorage."method_name"
```
#### local storage

```js
// Set a value in local storage
localStorage.setItem('username', 'john_doe');

// Get the value from local storage
const username = localStorage.getItem('username');

// Remove a value from local storage
localStorage.removeItem('username');

```
In this example, we are using the localStorage object to store the username "john_doe" locally in the user's browser. We can retrieve the value of "username" using the getItem() method and remove it using the removeItem() method.

```js
// Set a value in session storage
sessionStorage.setItem('isLoggedIn', true);

// Get the value from session storage
const isLoggedIn = sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggedIn');

// Remove a value from session storage
sessionStorage.removeItem('isLoggedIn');
```
In this example, we are using the sessionStorage object to store a boolean value indicating whether the user is logged in. Unlike local storage, session storage data is cleared when the user closes their browser window or tab, so this value will not persist beyond the current session.

Both local storage and session storage are key-value stores that allow you to store simple data types like strings, numbers, and booleans. However, it's important to be mindful of security considerations when storing sensitive information, such as user credentials or access tokens, in local or session storage. It's generally recommended to use more secure storage mechanisms like HTTP-only cookies or browser extensions to store such sensitive data.
